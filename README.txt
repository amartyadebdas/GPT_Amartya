Welcome to my Shakespeare-like document generator!

This program is a language model based on OpenAI's GPT architecture, which has been trained using TinyShakespeare (all of Shakespeare's work) as the dataset.

What does that mean? Essentially, the program has learned to generate text that resembles the writing style of Shakespeare himself. When given a prompt or starting sentence, the program will use its knowledge of Shakespeare's writing to

generate a new, unique document that sounds like it could have been written by the man himself.

This tool has a variety of potential use cases, from generating creative writing prompts to helping with content creation for marketing materials or social media posts. It could also be used as a fun way to explore the language and 

style of Shakespeare's writing.

While the architecture of this GPT is almost identical to that of GPT3, the amound of data that had been used to train this is insignificant compared to that used to train 

GPT3. This might take some time to load the data so thank you for your patience and I hope you are a fellow Shakespeare enthusiast.

While this program does require some technical expertise to build and train, it is designed to be easy to use for non-technical users. Simply enter a starting prompt or sentence, and let the program do the rest.

Thank you for considering my Shakespeare-like document generator. I hope you enjoy exploring the world of Shakespearean language and literature with it!
